# The entity model

An entity is a participant in a scenario — a vehicle, a pedestrian, or a
static object. Scena models entities exactly as ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML 1.4.0
§7.2.2 defines them: a `ScenarioObject` is a name-identified participant plus,
optionally, one **entity object** that classifies it.

> Scena targets OpenSCENARIO XML 1.0–1.3; the category enumerations carry the
> full 1.4.0 sets so any 1.0–1.3 document maps, with post-1.3 additions and
> deprecations noted on each value.

## The shape of an entity

Every entity has an `id`, a `name`, and a control mode
([engine- or host-controlled](conditions.md)). Beyond that it *may* carry one
concrete **entity object**:

- **Vehicle** — a category (car, bus, bicycle, …), an optional role, a bounding
  box, `Performance` limits, an axle set, and a properties list.
- **Pedestrian** — a category (pedestrian, animal), an optional role, a bounding
  box, and properties.
- **MiscObject** — a category (barrier, pole, tree, …), a bounding box, and
  properties.

An entity with **no object** is a valid *unclassified participant*: it has an
identity and a control mode but no geometry or performance. This is the minimal
form the earliest scenarios used, and it still works.

Three properties read the classification without unpacking the object yourself:

- `object_type` → `Vehicle` / `Pedestrian` / `MiscObject`, or absent.
- `bounding_box` → the object's box, or absent. This is the single geometry
  source the interaction conditions measure against.
- `performance` → the vehicle's limits, or absent (only vehicles have them).

## Bounding box and performance

The **bounding box** (`§BoundingBox`) is the geometric center in the entity
body frame (`+x` forward, `+y` left, `+z` up) plus `length`/`width`/`height`.
The 2D freespace kernel the interaction conditions use consumes `length`,
`width`, and the `x`/`y` center offset; `center_z`/`height` are stored but do
not enter the planar math.

**Performance** (`§Performance`) is `max_speed`, `max_acceleration`,
`max_deceleration` (all required, ranges `[0..inf[`) and two optional rate
limits (`max_acceleration_rate`, `max_deceleration_rate`) that mean "unbounded"
when absent. `Engine::init` rejects a negative, NaN, or non-finite value as a
validation error. The default longitudinal controller (a later sprint) clamps
target-speed setpoints against these limits.

**Axles** and **properties** are carried faithfully as data — the straight-line
runtime does not read them yet, but they round-trip unchanged for frontends and
hosts. Properties preserve authored order and duplicate names (a list, not a
map).

## Pose

An entity's kinematic state is a full Z-up, right-handed pose:
`x, y, z` (meters), `heading`, `pitch`, `roll` (radians, h/p/r per
`§Orientation`), and a scalar `speed` along the heading. The straight-line
runtime integrates position from speed and heading only, leaving `pitch`/`roll`
at 0; a host may report any pose for a host-controlled entity.

## Building entities

### C++

```cpp
scena::ir::Vehicle car;
car.category = scena::ir::VehicleCategory::Car;
car.bounding_box = {1.4, 0.0, 0.8, 4.6, 2.0, 1.5}; // center + L/W/H
car.performance = {55.0, 4.0, 9.0, std::nullopt, std::nullopt};

scena::ir::Entity ego;
ego.id = "ego";
ego.name = "ego";
ego.control_mode = scena::ir::ControlMode::HostControlled;
ego.object = car;

// Derived views:
auto type = scena::ir::object_type_of(ego);      // ObjectType::Vehicle
auto box  = scena::ir::bounding_box_of(ego);      // the car's box
auto* pf  = scena::ir::performance_of(ego);       // &car.performance
```

### Python

```python
import scena as scn

ego = scn.Entity(
    "ego", "ego", scn.ControlMode.HostControlled,
    object=scn.Vehicle(
        category=scn.VehicleCategory.Car,
        bounding_box=scn.BoundingBox(center_x=1.4, center_z=0.8,
                                     length=4.6, width=2.0, height=1.5),
        performance=scn.Performance(max_speed=55.0, max_acceleration=4.0,
                                    max_deceleration=9.0),
    ),
)
assert ego.object_type == scn.ObjectType.Vehicle
assert ego.performance.max_speed == 55.0
```

The spec's `none` role and MiscObject category are exposed in Python as `NONE`,
because Python does not allow the keyword `None` as an attribute name.

See [`python/examples/entity_model.py`](../../python/examples/entity_model.py)
for a runnable example.

### C ABI

Typed builders `scn_engine_add_vehicle`, `scn_engine_add_pedestrian`,
`scn_engine_add_misc_object` construct classified entities; the bounding box is
required and, for a vehicle, so is `scn_performance`. The read-back accessors
`scn_engine_entity_object_type`, `scn_engine_entity_bounding_box`, and
`scn_engine_entity_performance` query the authored scenario and are valid before
and after `scn_engine_init`.

## Not yet modeled

Entity **selections** (`EntitySelection`, `ByType`, `ByObjectType`) arrive with
the XML frontend catalogs (p4-s4). Trailers and hitches, the `model3d` render
hint, and catalog `parameterDeclarations` are out of the v0.0.1 entity scope.
Lowering the entity model from OpenSCENARIO XML lands with the frontend (P4).
